/*
 This is a more compact Event Dispatcher than the normal Blitz, but it is also a lot less optimized.
 If you prefer light-weight over performance, use this. If you don't, use https://github.com/CafeDevelopment/Blitz.

 P.S. this is a very small project that I will not be expanding nor improving after this release. I don't recommend using it at all.
